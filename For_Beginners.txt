Let's verify Playwright works with a quick command:
bash
playwright codegen https://demoqa.com

What this does:

codegen = Code Generator
Opens a Chromium browser
Opens Playwright Inspector
You can click on the page, and Playwright writes code for you!

Expected result:

Browser opens with demoqa.com
A separate "Playwright Inspector" window appears

Try this:

In the browser, click on "Elements" card
Watch the Inspector window - it generates code automatically!
Close everything when done

This is a POWERFUL feature for beginners!
