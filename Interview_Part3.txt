## 📝 Interview Questions You Can Now Answer

**Q: What is CI/CD and why is it important in QA automation?**

**A:**
"CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. In QA automation:

**Continuous Integration** means tests run automatically on every code change. This:
- Catches bugs immediately after code is written
- Prevents broken code from being merged
- Ensures code works on clean environments, not just locally
- Provides fast feedback to developers

**Benefits for QA:**
- No manual test execution needed
- Tests run on every push/PR automatically
- Consistent environment (no 'works on my machine' issues)
- Team sees test results in real-time
- Failed tests block deployment to production

I implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions, where tests run on Ubuntu with headless browsers on every push and pull request."

**Q: Explain your GitHub Actions workflow for running Playwright tests.**

**A:**
"My workflow has these steps:

1. **Trigger:** Runs on push to main and on pull requests
2. **Setup:** Uses Ubuntu latest with Python 3.11
3. **Install:** Installs dependencies from requirements.txt and Playwright browsers
4. **Execute:** Runs pytest with verbose output
5. **Artifacts:** Uploads screenshots and HTML reports if tests fail
6. **Timeout:** Cancels after 60 minutes to prevent hanging

The workflow ensures every code change is tested in a clean, consistent environment before merging. If tests fail, I can download artifacts to debug the issue."

**Q: What do you do when tests pass locally but fail in CI?**

**A:**
"I troubleshoot systematically:

1. **Check logs:** Review full CI logs for error details
2. **Environment differences:** CI is Ubuntu/headless, local might be Windows/headed
3. **Timing issues:** CI machines can be slower - I increase timeouts
4. **Dependencies:** Verify all dependencies installed correctly
5. **Test in similar environment:** Run tests locally with `headless=True`
6. **Artifacts:** Download screenshots from CI to see what failed

Common fixes:
- Increase element wait timeouts
- Add `playwright install --with-deps` for system dependencies
- Ensure tests don't rely on Windows-specific paths
- Use stable locators that work cross-platform"

**Q: How do you handle test failures in your CI pipeline?**

**A:**
"When tests fail in CI:

1. **Immediate visibility:** CI shows red X on PR - blocks merging
2. **Review logs:** Click 'Details' to see which tests failed and why
3. **Download artifacts:** Screenshots and HTML reports help debug
4. **Fix locally:** Reproduce issue, fix code, verify locally
5. **Push fix:** New commit triggers CI again
6. **Verify:** Green checkmark means safe to merge

For frequent failures (flaky tests):
- Increase timeouts
- Use Playwright's auto-waiting
- Add retries: `pytest --reruns 2`
- Fix root cause rather than ignoring

Status badges on README show team if main branch is healthy."
