What is a locator?

A way to find elements on the page
Like a GPS coordinate for web elements

Different selector types:
python# By ID
page.locator("#username")

# By class
page.locator(".card-body")

# By text content
page.locator("text=Elements")

# By CSS selector
page.locator("img[src='/images/Toolsqa.jpg']")

# By XPath
page.locator("//button[@id='submit']")

Element State Checks
pythonbanner.is_visible()     # Is element visible?
banner.is_enabled()     # Is element enabled (not disabled)?
banner.is_checked()     # Is checkbox/radio checked?
Returns: True or False

Counting Elements
pythoncards = page.locator(".card-body")
card_count = cards.count()  # Returns number of matching elements

pytest tests/test_homepage.py -v -s
```

**New flag: `-s`**
- Shows print statements in output
- Useful for debugging

📝 Interview Questions You Can Now Answer
Q: What is sync_playwright and why do we use it?
A:
"sync_playwright is the synchronous API of Playwright for Python. We use it because:

Easier to understand for beginners (sequential execution)
Sufficient for most test automation needs
No need to deal with async/await keywords
Alternative is async_playwright which uses Python's asyncio for concurrent operations"


Q: What is Playwright's auto-waiting feature?
A:
"Playwright automatically waits for elements before interacting with them. It checks if elements are:

Attached to DOM
Visible on screen
Stable (not animating)
Enabled (not disabled)
Not covered by other elements

Default timeout is 30 seconds. This eliminates most flaky tests caused by timing issues in Selenium."

Q: How do you locate elements in Playwright?
A:
"Playwright uses page.locator() with various selectors:

Text: page.locator('text=Login')
CSS: page.locator('#username') or page.locator('.card-body')
XPath: page.locator('//button[@id="submit"]')
Attribute: page.locator('[data-testid="login-btn"]')

Playwright's locators are lazy - they're evaluated when action is performed, making them more reliable than Selenium's immediate element finding."

Q: What's the difference between headless and headed mode?
A:
"- Headed (headless=False): Browser window is visible. Used for local development and debugging.

Headless (headless=True): Browser runs in background without UI. Used for CI/CD pipelines for faster execution and lower resource usage.

We test in both modes to catch issues that might only appear in one mode."
