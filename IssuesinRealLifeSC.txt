🚨 Common Mistakes & Real-Life Issues
Issue 1: Test file not discovered
Symptom: pytest finds 0 tests
Cause: File doesn't start with test_
Fix: Rename file to test_*.py

Issue 2: Function not discovered
Symptom: pytest skips your test
Cause: Function doesn't start with test_
Fix:
pythondef test_login():      # ✅ Correct
def verify_login():    # ❌ Won't run

Issue 3: Browser doesn't close
Cause: Test crashes before browser.close()
Fix: Use context manager (we already do this!)
pythonwith sync_playwright() as playwright:
    # Even if error occurs, resources cleanup automatically ✅

Issue 4: Element not found
Symptom: TimeoutError: Timeout 30000ms exceeded
Cause: Wrong selector or element doesn't exist
Debug:
python# Pause test to inspect page
page.pause()  # Opens Playwright Inspector

Issue 5: Test works locally but fails in CI
Cause: Headless mode behaves differently
Fix: Always test with both:
pythonheadless=False  # Local testing
headless=True   # CI/CD testing
